My thoughts for improvement on the OpenPipe API:

 * Use Spring Beans Validation framework instead of built-in one.
 * Use Spring's lifecycle for DocumentProducer init() & close(),
      and BasePipelineStep prepare() and finish().
  - will always call close(); have fail() be in addition. Is there a Spring facility for this?

 * How do steps produce more than one document or aggregate documents or filter out a document?
  - filtering: return null?  return some other pipeline step?
  - split or aggregate: use a document producer configured to take another document producer
